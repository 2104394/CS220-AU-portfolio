This writing briefly reflects on my understanding of


### My past/present digital identity/identities
Using the V&R map, I identified the following ways I engage with the Web in my visitor and resident modes (see photo/diagram below).

Di reflection <br>
<br>
What is a digital identity? <br>
<br>
A digital identity is how you engage with the internet and how you are perceived based upon that identity, an example of this is if a person uses the internet a lot for a professional life that would be their digital identity at least using the VR map method <br>
<br>
Previous ideas on digital identity <br>
<br>
One previous idea on digital identity was the idea of native and immigrants this meant that some people were raised on the internet and are well versed in how to operate on it and do so frequently for many tasks both professional and personal; however this is not detailed on this first model. Whilst others may try and engage with 
Current ideas on digital identity <br>
More specific to me <br>
<br>
My past in digital identity	<br>
<br>
In the past my digital identity was very limited, whilst I did interact from a very early age, since I was on the internet from the age of 3, I didn’t have any residency till secondary school with the VLE which would be a very mild form of professional / resident  at the same time I it wasn’t until 14 that I would gain twitter as a form residence and on the personal side of the VR map especially since its more public then finally gaining a lot more residency with more social media and other accounts such as Instagram Reddit and tiktok <br>
<br>
My current digital identity <br>
<br> 
my current digital identiy has things on both sides of the scale in  terms of resident to vistor since with a large usage of social media but due to the lack that interact with the outer world with my social media it does not lend itself to being the complete left side on any of my soical media apart from twtiter which i am mor active on but purly in a indivudal way since it is not in anyway used proffesionally
<br>
my current only proffesional entry on the VR map is the use of moodle or any account that is related to essex univeristy and so therefore is quite baron in comparrsion to other areas
<br>
My future plans for my digital identity <br>
<br>
i plan to become more of a visitor and possibliy more proffesional as i could take up blogging to note things that i think are important and as a creative outlet that i could to show skills and possibly get a job if not that then it could be considered more indivudal since i would be doing it for fun but regardless in professional manner and would not be connecting too much of a personal life too it
