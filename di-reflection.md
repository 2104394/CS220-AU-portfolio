## Reflection on digital identities

This writing briefly reflects on my understanding of

- digital identities in general
- my digital identities in the past/present
- my digital identities in the future

<br>

### Digital identities
To help identify and improve my digital identities, I explored 
- [White et al.'s Visitor and Resident (V&R) concept](http://daveowhite.com/vandr/) which 
  - says that there is a spectrum of way to interact with the internet which can be plotted on a vr map which can show where people lie on the resident to vistor line aswell as th 
  - and out of these, I found this and that interesting, and therefore researched them further and found this and that, etc.

### My past/present digital identity/identities
Using the V&R map, I identified the following ways I engage with the Web in my visitor and resident modes (see photo/diagram below).

Di reflection <br>
What is a digital identity? <br>
A digital identity is how you engage with the internet and how you are perceived based upon that identity, an example of this is if a person uses the internet a lot for a professional life that would be their digital identity at least using the VR map method <br>
Previous ideas on digital identity <br>

Whilst others may try and engage with 
Current ideas on digital identity <br>
More specific to me <br>
My past in digital identity	<br>
In the past my digital identity was very limited, whilst I did interact from a very early age, since I was on the internet from the age of 3, I didn’t have any residency till secondary school with the VLE which would be a very mild form of professional / resident  at the same time I it wasn’t until 14 that I would gain twitter as a form residence and on the personal side of the VR map especially since its more public then finally gaining a lot more residency with more social media and other accounts such as Instagram Reddit and tiktok <br>
