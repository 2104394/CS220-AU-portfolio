## Reflection on digital identities

This writing briefly reflects on my understanding of

- digital identities in general
- my digital identities in the past/present
- my digital identities in the future

<br>

### Digital identities
To help identify and improve my digital identities, I explored 
- [White et al.'s Visitor and Resident (V&R) concept](http://daveowhite.com/vandr/) which 
  - says that there is a spectrum of way to interact with the internet which can be plotted on a vr map which can show where people lie on the resident to vistor line aswell as th 
  - and out of these, I found this and that interesting, and therefore researched them further and found this and that, etc. 

<br>

### My past/present digital identity/identities
Using the V&R map, I identified the following ways I engage with the Web in my visitor and resident modes (see photo/diagram below).

To clarify, in 

- my visiting mode, the primary activities are google searches or looking 
- my resident mode, the primary activities are social media, watching videos and streams 
- the difference between my personal and institutional modes is ...
- etc. 

<br>

### My future digital identity/identities
To help develop my digital identities I have
- revised my current use of digital identities (thought about it critically)
- discussed it with my cohort/friends/parents
- found this and that in journal papers/books/internet which helped me understand where and how I could improve 
- used a [SWOT](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=swot&t=brave&ia=web) analysis (or another method that can help personal development) to understand my next steps
- etc. 


After identifying and analysing my current use of digital identities on the Web, I set the goal to ...

<br>

#### Objective 1 (example)
The above V&R map and its analysis highlighted ...

To address this (objective/weakness/threat, ...) I plan to 
- do this and that (read this and that, join a specific forum, amend/delete/add this or that, ...)
- by this deadline (perhaps you could write that you will set aside 1 hour every Monday to work on this objective)

<br>

#### Objective 2 (example)
...

By addressing these objectives my V&R map will look as follows:

### Summery
This writing reflected (or in this writing I reflected) on my understanding of

1. digital identities in general and highlighted this and that
2. my digital identities in the past/present and highlighted this and that
3. my digital identities in the future and highlighted this and that

### Questions you should/could export 
- do I know people who are much older than me and can use technology efficiently e.g. the Web more efficiently?
- what does it actually mean "to use the Web more efficiently"?
- what's the difference between White et al.'s and Prensky's idea regarding people engaging with technology?
- on the V&R map, what's the fundamental difference between 'visitor' modes and 'resident' modes and what does the 'personal on institutional' dimension provide?
- how have I been using digital technology in different contexts i.e. how has my 'digital journey' changed since my first device e.g. the one given to me by parents?
- how can/should I (or shouldn't) link my personal identities to my professional identities?
- what implications do my visitor identities have on my personal life?
- what implications do my personal identities have on my professional/institutional life?
- what implications do my resident identities have on my personal life?
- what implications do my resident identities have on my professional/institutional life?
- how do I assess the credibility of information of other people (or institutions) e.g. does it matter how good their profile picture looks or how well their website is designed? 
- how much fact-checking could people do when visiting my resident identities e.g. my websites or social accounts and who much fact-checking do I need to do when referencing others' work?
- is a piece of information's creditably in line with how high the information ranks using a search engine?
- is a piece of information's creditably in line with the creditability (or the number of followers) of a mainstream or alternative broadcaster, its references and perhaps who it was reviewed by? Can this information be biased or could there be a conflict of interest? 
- what does it mean to critically evaluate information i.e. what is critical thinking?
- how do I develop my critical thinking regarding my engagement on the Web in my visitor and resident modes?
- what is my digital capability e.g. what aspect of technology am I comfortable/uncomfortable with?
- how can I improve my online presence e.g. by monitoring the time I spend on social media vs. work when using my computing device?
- how can I improve the way I interact with information online e.g. can I access a more mindful/objective instead of a more reactive/emotional/biased state of mind before sharing or commenting on something online?
- what information about my developing digital identities am I confident sharing publicly?

### Thoughts
- maybe also have the two maps next to each other for easy comparison
