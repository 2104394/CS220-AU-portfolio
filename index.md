I’m Charles rumm, a Uni student currently studying psychology at the University of Essex; I’m 18 and have been interested in psychology for a while now


**studying psychology at university**  
I’m currently studying psychology at the university of Essex, I’ve had previous experience with psychology during my a level and learning a lot about how humans work with the applied human biology aspect 

<br>

## previous academic work
In terms of qualifications and academic work I have graduated from secondary school and college with both GCSEs and A-levels along with other experiences , the subjects chosen by me at those stages help with my interest in how humans work as college I chose psychology (which helps me currently in my current course) alongside sociology and applied human biology all geared to giving me a better understanding of how humans work which as mentioned before I carried on in Uni with my study in psychology which I hope to study later or use in some part of the service industry, in GCSE whilst my study was at a lower level I did subjects such as geography, biology, chemistry, maths, English language and literature, religious studies, ICT and computer science,

## Other relevant experience 

I took part in NCS meaning that I learnt that I had to display and learn skills such as problem solving, team work and public interaction as for the third week of NCS there was a charity week where we had to go out and raise money for a specific charity, this was defiantly the more tasking side of the NCS with this part needing to plan a way to raise money (we decided a sponsored walk) but also to work together to create things to raise awareness, all this was done as mentioned in one week so the time constraint meant it to be one quickly and effectively,  There was also the issue of not have a charity permit so we couldn’t accept in person money and had to try and direct people to pay online rather than giving away their change <br>
<br>
In school I was also a prefect, which involved having specific duties carried out at a certain time each day which meant I had to be on time and do my job, which meant I had to practice time management and committing to a specific task at hand which most of the time would be standing at points at the school calling out improper behaviour,  not only that but I was also tasked with faith related tasks such as helping out with the mass at our school since it was a religious school
